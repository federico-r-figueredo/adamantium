## The Adamantium Programming Language
Adamantium is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm and statically-typed programming language.

Adamantium emphasizes performance, type safety and concurrency. Adamantium enforces memory safety—that is, that all references point to valid memory—without requiring the use of a garbage collector or reference counting present in other memory-safe languages.
